### One
    import React from 'react';

    eslint will throw an error, that (React) is not defined.Because eslint doesnot know how React works
    To make it understand React well we have to add some packages

    * yarn add -D babel-eslint eslint-plugin-import eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y eslint-plugin-react
    a11y -> stands for accessibility

### Two -> jsx
    Q - What JSX Do?
    It's just translating those HTML tags into React.createElement calls. That's it. Really. No more magic here.

### Three -> component-name
    Composite Component name must be (capitalize).
    If you make it lowercase, it will try to have pet as a web component and not a React component.

### Four -> expression
    const x = name.toUpperCase()

    here as a whole it is an statement, but right side is an expression.
    (if...else) is a statement. But (ternery operator is an expression)

### Five - Hooks
    * All hooks name starts with "use". This is applicable for custom-hooks.

    * A fundamental thing about (hooks) is they never go inside of (if...else) statement.
    Also (for...loop) or any kind of logic.

    React keeps track of hooks by their order i am calling this things.If a hook is inside of a
    conditional logic it can break the order which will be a disaster.
